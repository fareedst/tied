# Implementation Decisions

**TIED Methodology Version**: 2.2.0

## Overview

This document serves as the **index** for all implementation decisions in this project. Each implementation decision is stored in its own file within the `implementation-decisions/` directory for scalability.

All decisions are cross-referenced with architecture decisions using `[ARCH-*]` tokens and requirements using `[REQ-*]` tokens for traceability.

**Source of consistent logic:** IMPL pseudo-code (`essence_pseudocode` in each IMPL detail file) is the **source of consistent logic** for the implementation. Logical and flow issues are resolved there before any tests or code are written; tests and code are derived from and must align with it.

## Directory Structure

```
tied/
├── implementation-decisions.md              # This guide file (you are here)
├── implementation-decisions.yaml            # YAML index/database of all implementation decisions
├── implementation-decisions/                # Detail files directory (YAML)
│   ├── IMPL-CONFIG_STRUCT.yaml
│   ├── IMPL-TIED_FILES.yaml
│   ├── IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION.yaml
│   └── ...
```

## Filename Convention

Token names contain `:` which is invalid in filenames on many operating systems. Use this mapping:

| Token Format | Filename Format |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `[IMPL-CONFIG_STRUCT]` | `IMPL-CONFIG_STRUCT.yaml` |
| `[IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION]` | `IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION.yaml` |

**Rule**: Replace `[`, `]`, and `:` → Remove brackets, replace `:` with `-`, append `.yaml`

## Notes

- All implementation decisions MUST be recorded IMMEDIATELY when made
- Each decision MUST include `[IMPL-*]` token and cross-reference both `[ARCH-*]` and `[REQ-*]` tokens
- Implementation decisions are dependent on both architecture decisions and requirements
- DO NOT defer implementation documentation - record decisions as they are made
- Record where code/tests are annotated so `[PROC-TOKEN_AUDIT]` can succeed later
- Include the most recent `[PROC-TOKEN_VALIDATION]` run information so future contributors know the last verified state
- **Language-Specific Implementation**: Language-specific implementation details (APIs, libraries, syntax patterns, idioms) belong in implementation decisions. Code examples in documentation should use `[your-language]` placeholders or be language-agnostic pseudo-code unless demonstrating a specific language requirement. Requirements and architecture decisions should remain language-agnostic.

## Core data object (IMPL detail YAML)

Every IMPL **detail** file in `implementation-decisions/` must use a single **root key** equal to the IMPL token (e.g. `IMPL-STORAGE_INDEX`). All content is nested under that key. This keeps each file self-identifying and machine-parseable and matches the index structure. This section is the **canonical schema** for validation and tooling.

### Core (required) fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Short human-readable title for the implementation decision. |
| `status` | string | One of: `Active`, `Deprecated`, `Template`, `Superseded`. |
| `cross_references` | list of strings | Tokens this IMPL links to (REQ-\*, ARCH-\*, other IMPL-\*). May be empty `[]`. |
| `rationale` | object | `why` (string), `problems_solved` (list of strings), `benefits` (list of strings). Lists may be empty. |
| `implementation_approach` | object | `summary` (string), `details` (list of strings). `details` may be empty. |
| `code_locations` | object | `files` (list of objects with `path`, optional `description`, optional `lines`), `functions` (list of objects with `name`, `file`, optional `description`). Either list may be empty. |
| `traceability` | object | `architecture` (list of ARCH-\* tokens), `requirements` (list of REQ-\* tokens), `tests` (list of test names or paths), `code_annotations` (list of tokens to appear in code). Lists may be empty. |
| `related_decisions` | object | `depends_on` (list), `supersedes` (list), `see_also` (list). All lists of decision tokens. |
| `detail_file` | string | Path to this detail file relative to `tied/` (e.g. `implementation-decisions/IMPL-STORAGE_INDEX.yaml`). |
| `metadata` | object | `created` (`date`, `author`), `last_updated` (`date`, `author`, `reason`), optional `last_validated` (`date`, `validator`, `result`). |
| `essence_pseudocode` | string (multiline) | **Mandatory.** Language-agnostic step-wise pseudo-code (main steps, data flow, control flow). Required for identifying collisions between implementation decisions (overlapping logic, data flow, ordering). See **Mandatory essence_pseudocode** below. |

### Optional but standard fields

Same shape in all files that use them:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `related_decisions.composed_with` | list of strings | IMPL tokens routinely composed with this one in a single algorithm. |

See **Optional fields for composition and workflow** below for usage.

### Mandatory essence_pseudocode

Every IMPL detail file **must** include an `essence_pseudocode` field. **Address all implementation issues (logical and flow) in pseudo-code before writing tests or code.** Pseudo-code is the **authoritative source of consistent logic**; tests and code follow from it. It is used to:

- Capture the implementation’s core algorithm in language-agnostic form (INPUT/OUTPUT/DATA, and CONTROL when relevant), procedure names, key branches.
- Support **collision detection**: when IMPLs are composed or share code paths, comparing their `essence_pseudocode` blocks helps identify overlapping steps, shared data, ordering dependencies, and conflicting assumptions.
- Once implemented, keep pseudo-code aligned with code and tests so documentation remains the single source of truth.
- **Algol-style notation:** Prefer Algol-style readability: clear control flow (if/then/else, loops, ON/WHEN), explicit INPUT/OUTPUT/DATA (and CONTROL when relevant), and procedure names in UPPER_SNAKE so blocks are easy to read and compare.
- **One action per step:** Each logical step in `essence_pseudocode` should express one clear action or decision (or one small, coherent block). Avoid long prose lines that mix multiple actions; that weakens collision detection and makes it harder to compare IMPLs and spot overlapping steps or ordering.
- **Traceability to tests:** Key branches and procedures in `essence_pseudocode` should be reflected in test names or test structure (e.g. one procedure or branch ≈ one `describe`/`it` or test section). That keeps the pseudo-code precise enough to guide tests and to detect when an IMPL’s behavior has drifted from its description.

### Preferred vocabulary for essence_pseudocode

Using a consistent vocabulary keeps blocks comparable and gives a stable description for tooling or AI. Prefer these keywords for the common cases:

- **Contract / structure:** INPUT, OUTPUT, DATA, CONTROL.
- **Events:** ON, WHEN.
- **Effects:** SEND, BROADCAST, RETURN.
- **Branches:** IF, ELSE.
- **Procedure names:** UPPER_SNAKE (e.g. `MODULE_IDENTIFICATION`); camelCase (e.g. `searchAndNavigate`) is acceptable when matching code. Authors may introduce domain terms but should prefer these keywords so collision detection and automated comparison remain reliable.
- **Loops:** `FOR item IN collection`, `FOR each (key, value) IN map` (or equivalent). Prefer `FOR ... IN` for iteration; add `WHILE condition` only if needed for clarity.
- **Errors and failure paths:** `ON error`, `ON failure` (event-style); `RETURN error` or `RETURN { error, ... }` for error results; `EXIT failure` for abort; `CATCH e RETURN ...` for caught exceptions. Use one consistent pattern per IMPL (e.g. all `ON error` or all `RETURN error`).
- **Async:** `AWAIT` for awaiting a promise; `Promise` in OUTPUT when the result is async; `SEND` implies async message send. Callers may `AWAIT` the result when relevant.
- **Data structures (optional):** Prefer `(list)`, `(array)`, `(set)`, `(map)` or key–value; object shapes as `{ key, key? }` or `{ key: type }`. Keep language-agnostic; no need to list every type.

Using these forms keeps collision detection and comparison reliable across IMPLs.

### Expressing sequence and structure

- **Order of steps:** Use numbered steps (`1.`, `2.`, …) for a fixed sequence (e.g. phases); use indentation under procedure names or `ON`/`WHEN` for the body of a step.
- **Contract block:** Start with a short "Contract:" line and/or explicit `INPUT:`, `OUTPUT:`, `DATA:`, and `CONTROL:` (when relevant) so readers and tooling can compare IMPLs by contract.
- Consistent sequence notation makes ordering dependencies visible during collision detection.

### Template and stub pseudo-code

- When an IMPL is a placeholder (e.g. status Template or early draft), `essence_pseudocode` may use a stub: a line `Template: placeholder for …` plus minimal `INPUT:`/`OUTPUT:` (possibly "(to be defined)") and one procedure stub. See IMPL-ERROR_HANDLING and IMPL-EXAMPLE_IMPLEMENTATION for examples.
- When status is Active, `essence_pseudocode` must be complete (no Template line; full contract and steps). This avoids ambiguity when comparing or composing IMPLs.

### Managed code and block token rules (REQ / ARCH / IMPL in pseudo-code)

These rules apply to **managed code** everywhere (source, tests, data, and pseudo-code in TIED detail YAML). Code for processing, support, or management of code (e.g. build scripts, linters, token validators) is **not** managed code.

1. **What is managed code**
   - Managed code is code developed with the TIED methodology to ensure correctness.
   - It appears in: **source code**, **tests**, **data**, and **pseudo-code in TIED detail YAML** (e.g. `essence_pseudocode` in IMPL detail files).

2. **Block and token naming**
   - Every **block** of managed code must include a comment that names all **REQ**, **ARCH**, and **IMPL** reflected in that block (i.e. whose implementation depends on that block), and states **how** that block implements the requirements.
   - For TIED tokens, a **block** is a contiguous sequence of code (complete logical units) that all implement the **same set** of REQ / ARCH / IMPL. A single block may contain **nested blocks** that implement a **different set** of REQ / ARCH / IMPL.

3. **Using token names selectively**
   - **Name tokens only where the set is defined or changes.** At the start of a block, name the full set (REQ, ARCH, IMPL) that the block implements. For nested blocks that implement the **same** set, do **not** repeat the token names; use a comment that only describes *how* that sub-block implements the requirements.
   - For a nested block that implements a **different** set (e.g. adds another IMPL or REQ), add a comment at the start of that nested block naming the tokens for **that** set (and briefly how it implements them).

4. **Applying this to IMPL pseudo-code**
   - In `essence_pseudocode`, add one top-level comment naming the IMPL, ARCH, and REQ tokens for the whole decision and a one-line summary of what the pseudo-code implements.
   - For each logical sub-block (e.g. INPUT/OUTPUT, a procedure, an event handler): if it implements the **same** set as the top level, comment only the *how* (no token list). If a sub-block implements a **different** set (e.g. depends on another IMPL), start that sub-block with a comment listing the tokens for that set and how the sub-block implements them.

### Minimal example of essence_pseudocode

The following is the minimal structure authors should follow; real IMPLs may be longer. It includes a top-level token comment, contract block, one procedure with one-action-per-step lines, and preferred keywords (IF/ELSE, RETURN, ON error).

```
# [IMPL-EXAMPLE] [ARCH-EXAMPLE] [REQ-EXAMPLE]
# One-line summary of what this pseudo-code implements.
# Contract: input and output; key data.
INPUT: key (string), options (optional)
OUTPUT: { result } or { error }; Promise when async
DATA: cache (map), lastKey (string)

# How this procedure implements the contract.
doWork(key, options):
  IF key empty: RETURN { error: "key required" }
  lookup = cache.get(key)
  IF lookup: RETURN { result: lookup }
  value = compute(key, options)
  cache.set(key, value); lastKey = key
  RETURN { result: value }
  ON error: RETURN { error: message }
```

### Extra fields

Any other **top-level keys** under the IMPL root (e.g. domain-specific prose or format keys) are allowed and need not be shared across files. Naming should avoid clashing with the core and optional-but-standard field names above.

### Canonical YAML shape

## How to Add a New Implementation Decision

1. **Create a new detail file** in `implementation-decisions/` using the naming convention above
2. **Use the detail file template** (see below)
3. **Add an entry to the index table** below
4. **Update `semantic-tokens.yaml`** registry with the new `[IMPL-*]` token

---

## Implementation Decisions Index

**The implementation decisions index is maintained in `implementation-decisions.yaml`**, a YAML database file that contains all implementation decision records with their metadata, cross-references, and status.

To view the index:

```bash
# View entire index
cat tied/implementation-decisions.yaml

# View specific decision
yq '.IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION' tied/implementation-decisions.yaml

# Get implementation approach summary
yq '.IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION.implementation_approach.summary' tied/implementation-decisions.yaml

# Get code file locations
yq '.IMPL-TIED_FILES.code_locations.files[].path' tied/implementation-decisions.yaml

# Get function locations
yq '.IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION.code_locations.functions[].name' tied/implementation-decisions.yaml

# Get architecture dependencies
yq '.IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION.traceability.architecture[]' tied/implementation-decisions.yaml

# List all active decisions
yq 'to_entries | map(select(.value.status == "Active")) | from_entries' tied/implementation-decisions.yaml

# Quick grep search
grep -A 30 '^IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION:' tied/implementation-decisions.yaml
```

### How to Append a New Implementation Decision

1. Open `implementation-decisions.yaml` in your editor
2. Copy the template block at the bottom of the file (IMPL-IDENTIFIER)
3. Paste it at the end with a blank line before it
4. Replace `IMPL-IDENTIFIER` with your new semantic token
5. Fill in all fields (name, status, cross_references, rationale, implementation_approach, etc.)
6. Update the `detail_file` path to match your new `.yaml` file in `implementation-decisions/` directory
7. Save the file

Example append operation:

```bash
cat >> tied/implementation-decisions.yaml << 'EOF'

### Optional fields for composition and workflow

Detail YAML files may include the following to support composing multiple IMPLs in one algorithm and to guide combined workflow description and test design:

- **`essence_pseudocode`** (**mandatory**, see Core data object): Language-agnostic, step-wise pseudo-code that captures the IMPL’s core algorithm: main steps, data flow (inputs, outputs, key structures), and control flow (branches, loops, ordering). Use a multi-line YAML string (e.g. `\|-`) for readability. When multiple IMPLs are combined in the same workflow, this pseudo-code is the primary artifact for deducing how IMPLs affect each other (ordering, shared data, dependencies), for producing a combined algorithm or workflow description, for guiding the design of tests and the structure of code, and for **collision detection** between implementation decisions.

- **`related_decisions.composed_with`** (optional): A list of IMPL tokens (e.g. `[IMPL-BOOKMARK_ROUTER, IMPL-STORAGE_INDEX]`) that record which IMPLs are routinely composed with this one in a single algorithm or workflow. Use this to document composition relationships alongside `depends_on`, `supersedes`, and `see_also`.

---

## Collision detection using essence_pseudocode

When IMPLs are composed (see `related_decisions.composed_with`) or share code paths, compare their **essence_pseudocode** blocks to:

1. **Identify overlapping steps or data** — e.g. both IMPLs read/write the same storage key or structure.
2. **Respect ordering dependencies** — e.g. IMPL-STORAGE_INDEX (index read/update) must be used before or after IMPL-BOOKMARK_ROUTER (resolve provider by URL) when saving; index update follows successful save.
3. **Avoid conflicting assumptions** — e.g. one IMPL assumes sync storage, another async.

**Process**: For each IMPL that lists others in `composed_with`, open the corresponding detail files and compare INPUT/OUTPUT/DATA and procedure names. Document ordering or shared-data notes in the IMPL’s `related_decisions.see_also` or in a short "Collision notes" extra field if needed.

**Key composition pairs (checklist)** — when changing these, re-check ordering and shared data:

| Composed pair / group | Ordering / shared data note |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| IMPL-STORAGE_INDEX, IMPL-BOOKMARK_ROUTER, IMPL-LOCAL_BOOKMARK_SERVICE | Router uses index to resolve provider; after save, router updates index. Migration (index seed) uses LocalBookmarkService.getAllBookmarks. |
| IMPL-MESSAGE_HANDLING, IMPL-POPUP_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT | Timeout wraps sendMessage; handler must complete before timeout. |
| IMPL-BADGE_REFRESH, IMPL-MESSAGE_HANDLING, IMPL-BOOKMARK_ROUTER | Badge refresh runs after message handling; may call router for bookmark state. |
| IMPL-URL_TAGS_DISPLAY, IMPL-BOOKMARK_ROUTER | Display reads bookmark/tags via router; no write ordering. |
| IMPL-FILE_STORAGE_TYPED_PATH, IMPL-FILE_BOOKMARK_SERVICE, IMPL-FILE_STORAGE_HELPER_PATH_NORMALIZE | Path normalize before typed path use; file service uses resolved path. |
| IMPL-CONFIG_MIGRATION, IMPL-CONFIG_BACKUP_RESTORE, IMPL-FEATURE_FLAGS | Backup/restore and migration read/write config; feature flags read config. |

Run this check when adding or changing `composed_with` or when modifying an IMPL’s core algorithm so that composed behavior remains consistent.

## Quick Reference: Creating a New Implementation Decision

```bash
# 1. Create the detail file
touch tied/implementation-decisions/IMPL-YOUR_TOKEN.yaml

# 2. Copy the template above into the new file

# 3. Fill in the details

# 4. Add entry to the index table in this file

# 5. Update semantic-tokens.yaml registry
```

---

## Grouping by Domain (Optional)

For very large projects, organize detail files by domain:

```
implementation-decisions/
├── core/
│   ├── IMPL-CONFIG_STRUCT.yaml
│   └── IMPL-ERROR_HANDLING.yaml
├── auth/
│   ├── IMPL-AUTH_FLOW.yaml
│   └── IMPL-SESSION_MGMT.yaml
└── api/
    └── IMPL-REST_ENDPOINTS.yaml
```

When using subdirectories, update the Detail File column in the index:
```markdown
| `[IMPL-AUTH_FLOW]` | Auth Flow | Active | ... | [Detail](implementation-decisions/auth/IMPL-AUTH_FLOW.yaml) |
```

---

## Migration from Monolithic File

If migrating from a single `implementation-decisions.md` file:

1. Create the `implementation-decisions/` directory
2. For each numbered section in the old file:
   - Create `IMPL-{TOKEN_NAME}.yaml` using the detail template
   - Copy content into the new file
   - Add metadata (Status, Created, Last Updated)
3. Replace section content in this file with an index row
4. Update `semantic-tokens.yaml` to note the new structure
5. Verify all links work correctly
