# Implementation Decisions

**TIED Methodology Version**: 2.2.0

## Overview

This document serves as the **index** for all implementation decisions in this project. Each implementation decision is stored in its own file within the `implementation-decisions/` directory for scalability.

All decisions are cross-referenced with architecture decisions using `[ARCH-*]` tokens and requirements using `[REQ-*]` tokens for traceability.

## Directory Structure

```
tied/
├── implementation-decisions.md              # This guide file (you are here)
├── implementation-decisions.yaml            # YAML index/database of all implementation decisions
├── implementation-decisions/                # Detail files directory (YAML)
│   ├── IMPL-CONFIG_STRUCT.yaml
│   ├── IMPL-TIED_FILES.yaml
│   ├── IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION.yaml
│   └── ...
```

## Filename Convention

Token names contain `:` which is invalid in filenames on many operating systems. Use this mapping:

| Token Format | Filename Format |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `[IMPL-CONFIG_STRUCT]` | `IMPL-CONFIG_STRUCT.yaml` |
| `[IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION]` | `IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION.yaml` |

**Rule**: Replace `[`, `]`, and `:` → Remove brackets, replace `:` with `-`, append `.yaml`

## Notes

- All implementation decisions MUST be recorded IMMEDIATELY when made
- Each decision MUST include `[IMPL-*]` token and cross-reference both `[ARCH-*]` and `[REQ-*]` tokens
- Implementation decisions are dependent on both architecture decisions and requirements
- DO NOT defer implementation documentation - record decisions as they are made
- Record where code/tests are annotated so `[PROC-TOKEN_AUDIT]` can succeed later
- Include the most recent `[PROC-TOKEN_VALIDATION]` run information so future contributors know the last verified state
- **Language-Specific Implementation**: Language-specific implementation details (APIs, libraries, syntax patterns, idioms) belong in implementation decisions. Code examples in documentation should use `[your-language]` placeholders or be language-agnostic pseudo-code unless demonstrating a specific language requirement. Requirements and architecture decisions should remain language-agnostic.

## Core data object (IMPL detail YAML)

Every IMPL **detail** file in `implementation-decisions/` must use a single **root key** equal to the IMPL token (e.g. `IMPL-STORAGE_INDEX`). All content is nested under that key. This keeps each file self-identifying and machine-parseable and matches the index structure. This section is the **canonical schema** for validation and tooling.

### Core (required) fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Short human-readable title for the implementation decision. |
| `status` | string | One of: `Active`, `Deprecated`, `Template`, `Superseded`. |
| `cross_references` | list of strings | Tokens this IMPL links to (REQ-\*, ARCH-\*, other IMPL-\*). May be empty `[]`. |
| `rationale` | object | `why` (string), `problems_solved` (list of strings), `benefits` (list of strings). Lists may be empty. |
| `implementation_approach` | object | `summary` (string), `details` (list of strings). `details` may be empty. |
| `code_locations` | object | `files` (list of objects with `path`, optional `description`, optional `lines`), `functions` (list of objects with `name`, `file`, optional `description`). Either list may be empty. |
| `traceability` | object | `architecture` (list of ARCH-\* tokens), `requirements` (list of REQ-\* tokens), `tests` (list of test names or paths), `code_annotations` (list of tokens to appear in code). Lists may be empty. |
| `related_decisions` | object | `depends_on` (list), `supersedes` (list), `see_also` (list). All lists of decision tokens. |
| `detail_file` | string | Path to this detail file relative to `tied/` (e.g. `implementation-decisions/IMPL-STORAGE_INDEX.yaml`). |
| `metadata` | object | `created` (`date`, `author`), `last_updated` (`date`, `author`, `reason`), optional `last_validated` (`date`, `validator`, `result`). |
| `essence_pseudocode` | string (multiline) | **Mandatory.** Language-agnostic step-wise pseudo-code (main steps, data flow, control flow). Required for identifying collisions between implementation decisions (overlapping logic, data flow, ordering). See **Mandatory essence_pseudocode** below. |

### Optional but standard fields

Same shape in all files that use them:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `related_decisions.composed_with` | list of strings | IMPL tokens routinely composed with this one in a single algorithm. |

See **Optional fields for composition and workflow** below for usage.

### Extra fields

Any other **top-level keys** under the IMPL root (e.g. domain-specific prose or format keys) are allowed and need not be shared across files. Naming should avoid clashing with the core and optional-but-standard field names above.

### Canonical YAML shape

```yaml
IMPL-TOKEN:           # root key = IMPL token; required
  name: string
  status: Active | Deprecated | Template | Superseded

## How to Add a New Implementation Decision

1. **Create a new detail file** in `implementation-decisions/` using the naming convention above
2. **Use the detail file template** (see below)
3. **Add an entry to the index table** below
4. **Update `semantic-tokens.yaml`** registry with the new `[IMPL-*]` token

---

## Implementation Decisions Index

**The implementation decisions index is maintained in `implementation-decisions.yaml`**, a YAML database file that contains all implementation decision records with their metadata, cross-references, and status.

To view the index:

```bash
# View entire index
cat tied/implementation-decisions.yaml

# View specific decision
yq '.IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION' tied/implementation-decisions.yaml

# Get implementation approach summary
yq '.IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION.implementation_approach.summary' tied/implementation-decisions.yaml

# Get code file locations
yq '.IMPL-TIED_FILES.code_locations.files[].path' tied/implementation-decisions.yaml

# Get function locations
yq '.IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION.code_locations.functions[].name' tied/implementation-decisions.yaml

# Get architecture dependencies
yq '.IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION.traceability.architecture[]' tied/implementation-decisions.yaml

# List all active decisions
yq 'to_entries | map(select(.value.status == "Active")) | from_entries' tied/implementation-decisions.yaml

# Quick grep search
grep -A 30 '^IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION:' tied/implementation-decisions.yaml
```

### How to Append a New Implementation Decision

1. Open `implementation-decisions.yaml` in your editor
2. Copy the template block at the bottom of the file (IMPL-IDENTIFIER)
3. Paste it at the end with a blank line before it
4. Replace `IMPL-IDENTIFIER` with your new semantic token
5. Fill in all fields (name, status, cross_references, rationale, implementation_approach, etc.)
6. Update the `detail_file` path to match your new `.yaml` file in `implementation-decisions/` directory
7. Save the file

Example append operation:

```bash
cat >> tied/implementation-decisions.yaml << 'EOF'

## Detail File Template

Use this template when creating a new implementation decision file in `implementation-decisions/`:

```markdown
# [IMPL-IDENTIFIER] Implementation Title

**Cross-References**: [ARCH-RELATED_ARCHITECTURE] [REQ-RELATED_REQUIREMENT]  
**Status**: Active  
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Decision

Brief description of the implementation decision.

## Rationale

- Why this implementation approach was chosen
- What problems it solves
- How it fulfills the architecture decision

## Implementation Approach

- Specific technical details
- Code structure or patterns
- API design decisions

### Data Structures

```[your-language]
// [IMPL-IDENTIFIER] [ARCH-RELATED_ARCHITECTURE] [REQ-RELATED_REQUIREMENT]
// Define your data structures here
type ExampleStruct struct {
    Field1 string
    Field2 int
}
```

### Key Algorithms

Description of key algorithms and their implementation.

### Platform-Specific Considerations

- Platform 1: Specific considerations
- Platform 2: Specific considerations

## Code Locations

Specific code locations, function names, or patterns to look for:
- **Files**:
  - `path/to/file.ext` (lines 10-50): Description of what's implemented there
- **Functions**:
  - `exampleFunction()` in `path/to/file.ext`: What it does

## Token Coverage `[PROC-TOKEN_AUDIT]`

Files/functions that must carry the `[IMPL-*] [ARCH-*] [REQ-*]` annotations:
- [ ] `path/to/implementation.ext` - Main implementation
- [ ] `path/to/helper.ext` - Helper functions

Tests that must reference the matching `[REQ-*]`:
- [ ] `testFeatureName_REQ_IDENTIFIER` in `path/to/test_file.ext`

## Validation Evidence `[PROC-TOKEN_VALIDATION]`

| Date | Commit | Validation Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | `abc1234` | ✅ Pass | Initial validation |

Latest `./scripts/validate_tokens.sh` output summary:

### Optional fields for composition and workflow

Detail YAML files may include the following to support composing multiple IMPLs in one algorithm and to guide combined workflow description and test design:

- **`essence_pseudocode`** (**mandatory**, see Core data object): Language-agnostic, step-wise pseudo-code that captures the IMPL’s core algorithm: main steps, data flow (inputs, outputs, key structures), and control flow (branches, loops, ordering). Use a multi-line YAML string (e.g. `\|-`) for readability. When multiple IMPLs are combined in the same workflow, this pseudo-code is the primary artifact for deducing how IMPLs affect each other (ordering, shared data, dependencies), for producing a combined algorithm or workflow description, for guiding the design of tests and the structure of code, and for **collision detection** between implementation decisions.

- **`related_decisions.composed_with`** (optional): A list of IMPL tokens (e.g. `[IMPL-BOOKMARK_ROUTER, IMPL-STORAGE_INDEX]`) that record which IMPLs are routinely composed with this one in a single algorithm or workflow. Use this to document composition relationships alongside `depends_on`, `supersedes`, and `see_also`.

## Quick Reference: Creating a New Implementation Decision

```bash
# 1. Create the detail file
touch tied/implementation-decisions/IMPL-YOUR_TOKEN.yaml

# 2. Copy the template above into the new file

# 3. Fill in the details

# 4. Add entry to the index table in this file

# 5. Update semantic-tokens.yaml registry
```

---

## Grouping by Domain (Optional)

For very large projects, organize detail files by domain:

```
implementation-decisions/
├── core/
│   ├── IMPL-CONFIG_STRUCT.yaml
│   └── IMPL-ERROR_HANDLING.yaml
├── auth/
│   ├── IMPL-AUTH_FLOW.yaml
│   └── IMPL-SESSION_MGMT.yaml
└── api/
    └── IMPL-REST_ENDPOINTS.yaml
```

When using subdirectories, update the Detail File column in the index:
```markdown
| `[IMPL-AUTH_FLOW]` | Auth Flow | Active | ... | [Detail](implementation-decisions/auth/IMPL-AUTH_FLOW.yaml) |
```

---

## Migration from Monolithic File

If migrating from a single `implementation-decisions.md` file:

1. Create the `implementation-decisions/` directory
2. For each numbered section in the old file:
   - Create `IMPL-{TOKEN_NAME}.yaml` using the detail template
   - Copy content into the new file
   - Add metadata (Status, Created, Last Updated)
3. Replace section content in this file with an index row
4. Update `semantic-tokens.yaml` to note the new structure
5. Verify all links work correctly
