# AI Agent Operating Guide

**Scope**: Entire repository (root unless overridden by nested `AGENTS.md` files)

**TIED Methodology Version**: 2.2.0

This document centralizes every instruction AI coding assistants must follow while working in TIED repositories. It supersedes reminders in `.ai-agent-instructions`, `.cursorrules`, and README snippets. Treat it as the canonical reference when configuring prompts, IDE rules, or agent workflows. For methodology background (what TIED is, costs and benefits, LEAP rationale), see `tied/docs/LEAP.md`, `implementation-decisions.md`, and `tied/docs/impl-code-test-linkage.md` (copied into the project by `copy_files.sh` when missing).

## 1. Mandatory Acknowledgment & Session Bootstrap

1. Preface **every** assistant response with:
   > `Observing AI principles!`
2. At session start (or when instructions may have changed), immediately:
   - Read `tied/docs/ai-principles.md` completely
   - Review `semantic-tokens.yaml` (token registry YAML index) and `semantic-tokens.md` (token guide)
   - Review `architecture-decisions.yaml` and `implementation-decisions.yaml` (YAML indexes)
   - Review `implementation-decisions.md` (implementation guide) for IMPL pseudo-code and block token rules ([PROC-IMPL_PSEUDOCODE_TOKENS])
   - Understand priority order: Tests > Code > Basic Functions > Infrastructure
   - Note: same filename everywhere—at repo root these files are templates; in `tied/` they are the project indexes.
   - **TIED MCP target (mandatory before MCP writes):** Call the TIED MCP tool **`tied_config_get_base_path`** and confirm the effective path is the **`tied/` directory of the repository you intend to change** (not another clone or parent methodology repo). If it is wrong, fix `.cursor/mcp.json` `env.TIED_BASE_PATH` to an **absolute** path to that project’s `tied/`, or re-run `./copy_files.sh /path/to/that/project` from the TIED repository so the script rewrites `tied-yaml` for that target. Prefer **one Cursor window per implementation repo** when editing project TIED YAML via MCP; multi-root workspaces can leave a single `TIED_BASE_PATH` pointing at the wrong folder (see `tied/citdp/CITDP-REQ-LEAP_PROPOSAL_QUEUE.yaml` RISK-010).
   - **TIED YAML update index:** For a single page that links the skill, MCP runbook, checklist steps, detail schema, and payload patterns, read `tied/docs/tied-yaml-agent-index.md`.
   - **Go `agentstream` (`tools/agentstream`):** Static **tied-yaml preflight** on `.cursor/mcp.json` is **off by default**. Enable with **`--tied-mcp-preflight`** or **`AGENTSTREAM_TIED_MCP_PREFLIGHT=1`** when you want validation before live turns; then non-interactive runs without a valid layout may need **`AGENTSTREAM_SKIP_TIED_MCP_PREFLIGHT=1`**, **`agentstream -y`**, or **`--skip-tied-mcp-preflight`**. See `tools/agentstream/README.md`.
3. Confirm access to the documents above before continuing.

## 2. Core TIED Obligations

- **Semantic Token Discipline**
  - Use `[REQ-*]`, `[ARCH-*]`, `[IMPL-*]`, and other TIED tokens everywhere (requirements, docs, code, tests).
  - Maintain traceability: Requirements → Architecture → Implementation → Tests → Code.
  - Update `semantic-tokens.yaml` immediately when introducing new tokens.
- **IMPL pseudo-code token comments (most critical)** `[PROC-IMPL_PSEUDOCODE_TOKENS]`
  - IMPL `essence_pseudocode` is the **most critical artifact** for implementation traceability. Without token comments in pseudo-code, traceability from REQ→ARCH→IMPL breaks at the pseudo-code layer and tests/code cannot be reliably aligned to requirements.
  - **Every block** in `essence_pseudocode` must have a comment that (1) names all REQ, ARCH, and IMPL reflected in that block and (2) states how that block implements those requirements. Top-level: one comment naming IMPL, ARCH, and REQ plus a one-line summary; sub-blocks with the same set → comment only the "how"; sub-blocks with a different set → comment listing that set and how the sub-block implements it.
- **Documentation-First Flow**
  - Expand requirements into pseudo-code and decisions before any code changes.
  - Address all implementation issues (logical and flow) in IMPL pseudo-code before tests or code; IMPL `essence_pseudocode` is the **source of consistent logic** for implementation.
  - Record architecture decisions (`architecture-decisions.md`) with `[ARCH-*]` tokens cross-referencing requirements.
  - Record implementation decisions (`implementation-decisions.md`) with `[IMPL-*]` tokens cross-referencing `[ARCH-*]` and `[REQ-*]` tokens.
  - Never defer documentation; update as you think, design, and implement.
- **LEAP: Logic Elevation And Propagation** (see `tied/processes.md` § LEAP / [PROC-LEAP])
  - When code or tests written during TDD/E2E differ from IMPL, update the stack in **reverse order**: **IMPL → ARCH → REQ** in the same work item so tokens stay consistent and testable.
  - Work may start at any layer (REQ, ARCH, IMPL, or code/tests); for work to be **complete**, apply changes **up and down** the stack as needed. Code is valid only when **all tests pass** and **all requirements are met**.
- **Implementation order** (see `tied/processes.md` § PROC-TIED_DEV_CYCLE): (1) **Unit tests first** — tests conform to IMPL pseudo-code, written before production code (strict TDD). (2) **Unit code via TDD** — code is written to satisfy the tests; entire IMPL pseudo-code is implemented via TDD. (3) **Composition tests first** — for every binding between units (event listeners, IPC, entry-point wiring), write failing component/integration/contract tests before composition code; each test verifies the connection without invoking the UI. (4) **Composition code via TDD** — binding/wiring/entry-point code written to satisfy composition tests; no composition code without a failing test. (5) **E2E** — only for behavior that requires UI invocation; each E2E test must justify why it cannot be tested at composition level. (6) **Closing the loop** — update TIED data; run `tied_validate_consistency` (or equivalent).
- **Primary implementation checklist** — For the unified, step-by-step procedure that sequences CITDP analysis, LEAP, TDD, composition, E2E, and validation into a single executable checklist, follow `tied/docs/agent-req-implementation-checklist.md` (`[PROC-AGENT_REQ_CHECKLIST]`). Use it as the primary resource for every new REQ or change to the tested system. A trackable YAML with completion and loop-back fields is at `tied/docs/agent-req-implementation-checklist.yaml` (copy to a unique per-request file in a working folder per the YAML header).
- **Module Validation Mandate `[REQ-MODULE_VALIDATION]`**
  - Identify logical modules and their boundaries before implementation.
  - Develop and validate each module independently (unit tests with mocks, contract tests, edge cases, error handling) before integration.
  - Only integrate modules after validation passes. Document validation results.
- **Priority Order**
  - Always prioritize: Tests, Code, Basic Functions ➜ Developer experience ➜ Infrastructure ➜ Security.
- **TIED data access (MCP-first)**
  - **Index of docs for YAML updates:** `tied/docs/tied-yaml-agent-index.md` (skill, runbook, checklist, schema, base path).
  - Use the **TIED MCP server** (tools and resources) as the **primary** way to read and write TIED data. In Cursor, that server may appear under a project-specific label (e.g. `project-0-stdd-tied-yaml`); treat it as the **TIED YAML MCP** regardless of display name. TIED is the db that controls/directs the build; significant code is created in TIED first, then implemented with TDD. Writing TIED YAML via MCP ensures valid output (e.g. values containing `:` are quoted); direct file edits often produce invalid YAML. **Direct file access** to TIED content (under `tied/` or `TIED_BASE_PATH`) is permitted **only when** no MCP tool supports the operation; document such cases so they can be considered for new MCP tooling.
  - **Wrong `TIED_BASE_PATH` (high impact):** MCP `yaml_*` tools write under whatever directory `TIED_BASE_PATH` resolves to. A session opened on repo A while `TIED_BASE_PATH` still points at repo B will mutate B’s `tied/` silently. Mitigation: **`tied_config_get_base_path` at session start**; align `.cursor/mcp.json` with the active repo; if MCP cannot target the correct tree, document **TIED_YAML_BYPASS** and edit only the intended absolute paths, then `lint_yaml` (see `tied/implementation-decisions/IMPL-MCP_LEAP_PROPOSAL_QUEUE.yaml` `yaml_writer_note`, CITDP RISK-010).
  - **When using MCP:** Prefer tools for index read/list/filter, detail read/write, traceability (`get_decisions_for_requirement`, `get_requirements_for_decision`), validation (`yaml_index_validate`, `tied_validate_consistency`), and token creation (`tied_token_create_with_detail`). Prefer resources (e.g. `tied://requirements`, `tied://requirement/{token}/detail`) for loading context. Before changing TIED content, read via MCP; after changing, use the appropriate write/update tool. Validate all changed TIED YAML with `lint_yaml` per [PROC-YAML_EDIT_LOOP] (see `processes.md` § `[PROC-YAML_EDIT_LOOP]`); do not use raw multi-argument `yq` for pretty-print. YAML that does not validate is invalid for use. Run **`tied_validate_consistency`** before marking work complete.
- **Client inheritance of LEAP R+A+I**
  - **All TIED projects inherit the LEAP R+A+I** via `copy_files.sh`: the client's `tied/` contains the methodology-enforcing REQ/ARCH/IMPL and PROC tokens (e.g. REQ-TIED_SETUP, REQ-MODULE_VALIDATION, ARCH-TIED_STRUCTURE, ARCH-MODULE_VALIDATION, IMPL-TIED_FILES, IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION, [PROC-LEAP], and related process tokens) and their detail files so that TIED and LEAP behaviors exist in every project. These tokens are **mandatory for TIED success** and must not be removed.
  - **TIED-sourced YAML is read-only in the client** ([PROC-TIED_METHODOLOGY_READONLY]): methodology content lives under `tied/methodology/` (index YAMLs and inherited detail files from TIED `templates/`). It is used but **not modified** in the client; it does not hold client-specific data. Re-run `copy_files.sh` to refresh methodology; it overwrites only `tied/methodology/`.
  - **Client-specific data** lives only in **project** YAML: `tied/requirements.yaml`, `tied/architecture-decisions.yaml`, `tied/implementation-decisions.yaml`, `tied/semantic-tokens.yaml`, and the corresponding `tied/requirements/`, `tied/architecture-decisions/`, `tied/implementation-decisions/` detail dirs at the root of `tied/`. MCP and agents must **only write to project YAML**; validate/read may use a merged view (methodology + project). Project files are never overwritten by `copy_files.sh`.
  - For structure and sample records, agents refer to **`templates/`** in the TIED repository—the same content that `copy_files.sh` copies into the client's `tied/methodology/`. The client's full TIED view is methodology (read-only) plus project-specific entries in project YAML.
- **Client-only vs methodology-repo project YAML (policy / LEAP)**
  - A repository that **implements** a feature (code, tests, scripts) may carry project REQ/ARCH/IMPL tokens for that feature in **its own** `tied/` (e.g. `REQ-GOAGENT-*` in a repo that ships `tools/agentstream` and root smoke scripts). That is normal traceability, not “methodology pollution.”
  - If product policy requires **feature documentation to live only in a different client repo**, do not delete tokens ad hoc: run a **LEAP-aligned migration** (move or duplicate indexes and detail files, update `semantic-tokens.yaml`, validate both trees with **`tied_validate_consistency`**). Treat this as a scoped change request, not a one-off file delete.

## 3. Operational Checklists

### 3.1 Start-of-Response Checklist (repeat every turn)
- `"Observing AI principles!"` acknowledgment
- Confirm `tied/docs/ai-principles.md` has been read this session
- Reference current semantic tokens, architecture, and implementation decisions

### 3.2 Before Starting Work
- [ ] Verify all documents in Section 1 have been reviewed
- [ ] **TIED MCP:** Call **`tied_config_get_base_path`** and confirm the path matches the **`tied/` of the repo under change** before any MCP write to project YAML
- [ ] Understand current priorities and dependencies
- [ ] Review existing semantic tokens, architecture decisions, and implementation decisions related to the work
- [ ] **IMPL `essence_pseudocode`**: Every block has a comment naming REQ/ARCH/IMPL and how the block implements them ([PROC-IMPL_PSEUDOCODE_TOKENS])

### 3.3 During Work
- [ ] **Do not edit methodology YAML** in the client (`tied/methodology/`); add and edit REQ/ARCH/IMPL only in **project** YAML under `tied/` ([PROC-TIED_METHODOLOGY_READONLY]).
- [ ] Use semantic tokens in code comments and test names
- [ ] **IMPL `essence_pseudocode`**: Every block has a comment naming REQ/ARCH/IMPL and how the block implements them; add/update when authoring or editing IMPL pseudo-code
- [ ] When authoring or editing IMPL pseudo-code, run pseudo-code validation per `[PROC-PSEUDOCODE_VALIDATION]` (see `tied/docs/pseudocode-writing-and-validation.md`); required checks are gating before tests/code
- [ ] Keep documentation synced as decisions change
- [ ] Maintain module boundaries and validate independently before integration
- [ ] **Run language-specific lint after each code-generation iteration**: **Rust** → `bun run lint:rust` [PROC-RUST_LINT]; **TypeScript** → `bunx tsc -b` or `bun run lint:ts` [PROC-TS_CHECK]; **Swift** → `swift build && swift test` [PROC-SWIFT_BUILD]; **YAML** → run `lint_yaml` on changed YAML files [PROC-YAML_EDIT_LOOP] (when TIED YAML is created or updated); see `processes.md` for safe multi-file use. Fix before proceeding. Code and YAML that do not pass lint are incomplete ([PROC-TIED_DEV_CYCLE] inner loop).
- [ ] Keep descriptive debug output (e.g., `DEBUG:`, `TRACE:`, `DIAGNOSTIC:`) to document decision points and execution flow; retain unless explicitly asked to remove
- [ ] Record new `[ARCH-*]` and `[IMPL-*]` entries immediately with cross-references
- [ ] **Validate all changed TIED YAML** with `lint_yaml` per [PROC-YAML_EDIT_LOOP]; YAML that does not validate is invalid for use
- [ ] **Verification-gated mode** ([PROC-TIED_VERIFICATION_GATED]): When the project uses verification-gated mode, do not edit requirement or IMPL `status` by hand; run the verify step (e.g. `tied_verify` with update) after tests so status is derived from test results only.

### 3.4 After Completing Work
- [ ] `semantic-tokens.yaml` reflects every token referenced in code/tests/docs
- [ ] Architecture and implementation decision logs are current and cross-referenced
- [ ] If code or tests diverged from IMPL: IMPL (and ARCH/REQ if scope changed) updated in reverse order so the stack is consistent
- [ ] Tests reference their corresponding semantic tokens
- [ ] Module validation status is documented
- [ ] All documentation matches the implemented state (no drift)
- [ ] Verify all code and tests are consistently linked to requirements and decisions; update code and documentation where necessary
- [ ] **Validate all changed TIED YAML** with `lint_yaml` per [PROC-YAML_EDIT_LOOP]; YAML that does not validate is invalid for use
- [ ] Run **`tied_validate_consistency`** (TIED MCP tool) and fix any reported issues so REQ→ARCH→IMPL indexes, detail files, and token references remain consistent; align with `[PROC-TOKEN_VALIDATION]` and any project `validate_tokens.sh`.
- [ ] **Verification-gated mode**: When the project uses verification-gated mode ([PROC-TIED_VERIFICATION_GATED]), run the project's **verify step** after tests (e.g. MCP `tied_verify` with update) so requirement and optionally IMPL status are derived from test results; then run `tied_validate_consistency`.
- [ ] Do not create a stand-alone summary document for the session (e.g. no SESSION_SUMMARY.md or similar)

## 4. Debug & Logging Expectations

- Provide rich debug output during implementation to trace execution flow, state transitions, and decision points.
- Prefix diagnostic logs with clear labels (`DEBUG:`, `TRACE:`, `DIAGNOSTIC:`) to aid future analysis.
- Preserve debug statements unless stakeholders explicitly request removal; they serve as inline documentation of architecture/implementation rationale.

---

## 5. Key Files & Responsibilities

Same filename at repo root (template) and in `tied/` (project index); location distinguishes use. **Methodology** (TIED-sourced) index YAMLs and inherited detail files are copied into **`tied/methodology/`** and are **read-only** in the client ([PROC-TIED_METHODOLOGY_READONLY]). **Project** index and detail files live at **`tied/`** root (e.g. `tied/requirements.yaml`, `tied/requirements/`) and hold only client-added tokens; agents and MCP write only there. Agents refer to `templates/` in the TIED repo for the canonical structure and sample records.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tied/docs/ai-principles.md` | Master principles and process guide (read fully every session) |
| `semantic-tokens.yaml` | YAML index/database of all semantic tokens (canonical registry) |
| `semantic-tokens.md` | Semantic tokens guide with format, naming conventions, and usage examples |
| `requirements.md` | Requirements guide with documentation (copy from root into project's tied/) |
| `requirements.yaml` | Requirements YAML index/database with all requirement records |
| `requirements/` | Individual requirement detail files (YAML, e.g., `REQ-TIED_SETUP.yaml`); schema: `detail-files-schema.md` |
| `architecture-decisions.md` | Architecture decisions guide with documentation (copy from template per project) |
| `architecture-decisions.yaml` | Architecture decisions YAML index/database with `[ARCH-*]` records tied to requirements |
| `architecture-decisions/` | Individual architecture decision detail files (YAML, e.g., `ARCH-TIED_STRUCTURE.yaml`) |
| `implementation-decisions.md` | Implementation decisions guide with documentation (copy from template per project) |
| `implementation-decisions.yaml` | Implementation decisions YAML index/database with `[IMPL-*]` records tied to requirements + architecture |
| `implementation-decisions/` | Individual implementation decision detail files (YAML, e.g., `IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION.yaml`) |
| `detail-files-schema.md` | Schema for REQ/ARCH/IMPL detail YAML files (in TIED repo or tied/) |
| `tied/processes.md` | Process tracking including `[PROC-YAML_DB_OPERATIONS]`, LEAP, PROC-TIED_DEV_CYCLE; new clients get an initial copy from `templates/processes.md` via `copy_files.sh`. Use TIED MCP as primary interface to TIED data (see §2 TIED data access). |
| `tied/docs/agent-req-implementation-checklist.md` | Primary step-by-step checklist for implementing any new REQ or change; unifies CITDP, TIED dev cycle, IMPL_CODE_TEST_SYNC, LEAP, and validation into one executable procedure (`[PROC-AGENT_REQ_CHECKLIST]`). Trackable YAML: `tied/docs/agent-req-implementation-checklist.yaml` (copy to unique per-request file per its header). |
| `tied/docs/pseudocode-writing-and-validation.md` | How to write and validate IMPL pseudo-code; when to run validation; minimum gating rules (`[PROC-PSEUDOCODE_VALIDATION]`). Checklist: `tied/docs/pseudocode-validation-checklist.yaml`. |
| `.cursorrules` | IDE loader that points back to this document |
| `.ai-agent-instructions` | Quick reminder pointing to this document |

---

## 6. Presenting These Instructions to Agents

You can apply these rules in several ways:

1. **System Prompt Snippet**
   ```
   MANDATORY: Preface every response with "Observing AI principles!"
   Then follow the AGENTS.md checklists (read tied/docs/ai-principles.md, review semantic tokens, architecture, implementation decisions, maintain semantic traceability, module validation, documentation, and priority order).
   ```
2. **IDE Integration (`.cursorrules`)** – keep a lightweight loader that links directly to `AGENTS.md` so Cursor automatically enforces the rules.
3. **README / Onboarding** – reference `AGENTS.md` in project READMEs or onboarding docs to remind contributors where the canonical rules live.

---

## 7. Maintenance

- Update `AGENTS.md` whenever AI-facing processes change.
- Mirror changes into `tied/docs/ai-principles.md` and related docs as needed.
- Nested directories may introduce their own `AGENTS.md` to extend or override these rules within their subtree; the most specific file wins.
