# Agent Requirement Implementation Checklist

**Audience**: AI agents. Process token: `[PROC-AGENT_REQ_CHECKLIST]`.

**Purpose**: This document is the primary procedural template an AI agent follows for every new requirement or change to the tested system. It unifies and sequences the controlling processes into a single executable checklist with explicit branching and looping. The agent executes this checklist from start to finish; skipping steps is not permitted unless a branch directive says otherwise.

**Trackable form**: The executable checklist YAML (with `id`, `slug`, completion comments, and loop-back clearance) is [`docs/agent-req-implementation-checklist.yaml`](agent-req-implementation-checklist.yaml) (version in-file). The same content is mirrored at `tied/docs/agent-req-implementation-checklist.yaml` for methodology bundles (`copy_files.sh`). Copy either to a unique per-request file in a working folder (see the YAML header) and use it to record step completion and loop-backs.

**Processes unified here**: `[PROC-CITDP]`, `[PROC-TIED_DEV_CYCLE]`, `[PROC-IMPL_CODE_TEST_SYNC]`, `[PROC-LEAP]`, `[PROC-YAML_EDIT_LOOP]`, `[PROC-IMPL_PSEUDOCODE_TOKENS]`, `[PROC-PSEUDOCODE_VALIDATION]`, `[PROC-TOKEN_AUDIT]`, `[PROC-TOKEN_VALIDATION]`, `[PROC-TEST_STRATEGY]`, `[PROC-COMMIT_MESSAGES]`.

**Mandatory order**: IMPL pseudo-code (every block token-commented) → RED tests (with token comments) → code (with token comments). No code before RED; no RED before complete IMPL pseudo-code.

**Step `id` and `slug`**: Each YAML step has a stable **`id`** (used in GOTO, loop-back clearance, and tooling) and a kebab-case **`slug`** (for stable references in docs and code). Titles match the executable YAML (`version` / `last_updated` in that file).

## Entry Points

| Scenario | Start at | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| New requirement | session-bootstrap | Full checklist applies |
| Change to existing system | session-bootstrap | CITDP analysis applies at change-definition-impact-discovery; existing tokens loaded at impact-discovery |
| TIED prepared; tests/code not updated | session-bootstrap | author-requirement–S06 verify-only; use updated REQ/ARCH/IMPL as source of truth; follow [PROC-TIED_FIRST_IMPLEMENTATION](tied-first-implementation-procedure.md) |
| Bug fix | session-bootstrap | At change-definition, determine if a REQ is missing; if so, create REQ at author-requirement before defining the fix |

### Variant: TIED prepared, implementation pending

When REQ/ARCH/IMPL have already been updated and the remaining work is to align tests and code: use the checklist from session-bootstrap. change-definition–impact-discovery define the change and impact from the **updated** TIED (desired behavior = new design; current behavior = prior tests/code). author-requirement–S06 are **verify-only** (confirm REQ/ARCH/IMPL completeness and block token comments; fix gaps before proceeding). risk-assessment–traceable-commit are unchanged. Full procedure: [tied-first-implementation-procedure.md](tied-first-implementation-procedure.md) (`[PROC-TIED_FIRST_IMPLEMENTATION]`).

## Suggested session handoffs (non-normative)

This section is **optional guidance** only. Checklist order and gating are unchanged. Use these boundaries when the **repository** and **per-request checklist copy** (per the YAML header) already record enough work that a **new** session can re-bootstrap with a small prompt, avoid carrying long prior turns, and focus on the next phase.

**CITDP vs the CITDP file:** In `tied/processes.md`, `[PROC-CITDP]` ties `change-definition`, `impact-discovery`, `risk-assessment`, and `test-strategy` to change analysis, and the **`persist-citdp-record`** step (slug `persist-citdp-record`) stores the final `CITDP-*.yaml` under `tied/citdp/`. A typical “analysis done, start test/code” handoff is after IMPL is persisted and the **implementation freeze** lifts: **`persist-implementation-records`**, then `risk-assessment` / `test-strategy`, then TDD. That is **not** the same as writing the final CITDP YAML file, which runs **after** implementation.

### High-value new-session boundaries (efficiency)

| After step (slug) | Durable state | When a new session helps |
|---|---|---|
| `persist-implementation-records` | IMPL index/detail, indexes, and tokens on disk; `gate-pseudocode-validation` and this step satisfied. Implementation freeze (see `session-bootstrap`) lifted for the IMPL set in scope. | Strongest split before RED/GREEN. Dropped context: long catalog/flag/resolve/validation reasoning. New session: continue `risk-assessment` or `test-strategy` then TDD. Aligns with the **TIED prepared; tests/code not updated** entry point. |
| `test-strategy` | Test matrix and TDD order as step outcomes. | **Implementation-only** context: from `unit-test-red` with harness and IMPL details as source of truth. |
| `risk-assessment` | Risks and mitigations documented; IMPL on disk. | Weaker than after `test-strategy`; use when the risk pass was long or branchy. |
| `three-way-alignment-unit` → `unit-test-red` (per iteration) | Tests and code for prior blocks; IMPL may have been updated via `sub-leap-micro-cycle` / LEAP. | Very large REQs/IMPLs: a **narrow** session per block or per RED/green/align loop without earlier failure-transcript context. |
| `three-way-alignment-unit` → `composition-integration` (when all required unit blocks are done) | Unit-level TDD and alignment are stable. | **Composition** and wiring are a different kind of work than unit TDD. |
| `end-to-end-ui` | E2E and lower layers addressed per scope. | A dedicated **`verification-gate`**: full suite, post-test pseudo-code validation, token validation, audit. |
| `verification-gate` | Suite, lint, and post-test validation green for the pass. | **Close-out** without debug narrative: `sync-tied-stack`, `user-facing-release-notes` (if in scope), `persist-citdp-record`, `traceable-commit`. |
| `persist-citdp-record` | `CITDP-*.yaml` on disk. | Short **commit** session: `traceable-commit` (see the `traceable-commit` and `session-bootstrap` notes on `CALL` / `RETURN` for driver-appended sub-procedure turns). |

**Agentstream (`--lead-checklist-yaml` in the consumer repo’s `tools/agentstream` and `tools/agent-stream`):** The executable YAML sets `agentstream_new_session: true` on the main steps that begin a handoff in the table (for example `risk-assessment` through to `sync-tied-stack` per the canonical `docs/agent-req-implementation-checklist.yaml` at the repo root). The driver then issues that turn without `--resume` (a new Cursor agent session). Missing or `false` keeps chaining from the previous turn. This key is a **driver hint**; the procedural checklist and gating do not depend on it, and other clients may ignore it. Mid-run new sessions are independent of a prior turn’s `session_id`; `--session-id` (when supported) still applies to **turn 1** of the run only.

**Session preload file:** When a workspace has **`agent-preload-contract.yaml` at the repo root** (optional; used by agentstream and batch scripts when present), the checklist’s **`author-architecture`** and **`persist-implementation-records`** steps require creating or updating it (see the bundled [`agent-preload-contract-template.yaml`](../../docs/agent-preload-contract-template.yaml) in the TIED source tree, or the consumer’s copy under `tied/docs/`; use [`agent-preload-contract-tied-repo.yaml`](../../docs/agent-preload-contract-tied-repo.yaml) when indexes live at the repo root). A filled preload is not a substitute for REQ+ARCH-bounded system definition; refresh after **ARCH-locked** constants, then after **IMPL-locked** `code_locations` and paths. **`sync-tied-stack`** re-checks the file if REQ/IMPL status or `traceability.tests` changed. See the executable YAML in `tied/docs/agent-req-implementation-checklist.yaml` for exact task text.

**Weaker handoffs (use only for very large work):** After `change-definition` or `impact-discovery`, REQ/ARCH/IMPL may not be complete on disk—treat the new session as **resume and verify**, not “TIED is done.” After `author-architecture`, a new session at `catalog-pseudocode-contracts` can work if ARCH/REQ files were actually written and indexed.

**Avoid starting a new session in the middle of:** `loop_back_clearance` / GOTO flow from `resolve-pseudocode` to `author-requirement` or `author-architecture` (scope and cleared slugs are coupled; see the executable YAML’s `loop_back_clearance`); and **`sub-leap-micro-cycle`** during **`unit-test-green`** unless IMPL, test, and code are left in a self-explanatory, aligned state and the per-request checklist slugs are explicit.

**Minimal restart prompt:** Point to the per-request checklist file and next **slug**; name REQ/ARCH/IMPL token(s) and the relevant `tied/implementation-decisions/IMPL-*.yaml` (and indexes) as source of truth. If `persist-implementation-records` and gating are already completed for this change on disk, do not re-derive the pseudo-code sequence from scratch; continue from the completed steps.

## session-bootstrap (session-bootstrap): Governed TIED context and skill-routed YAML path

**Goals**: Confirm access to all governing TIED documents; understand current project state and priorities.

**Tasks**:
1. Preface the response with `"Observing AI principles!"`.
2. Read `ai-principles.md` completely.
3. Review `tied/semantic-tokens.yaml` (token registry) and `tied/semantic-tokens.md` (token guide).
4. Review `tied/architecture-decisions.yaml` and `tied/implementation-decisions.yaml` (YAML indexes).
5. Review `tied/implementation-decisions.md` (IMPL schema, pseudo-code rules, block token rules per `[PROC-IMPL_PSEUDOCODE_TOKENS]`).
6. **Tied-yaml skill (required)**: Read [.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/SKILL.md](.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/SKILL.md). For a single page linking the skill, MCP runbook, detail schema, and payload patterns, read [../../docs/tied-yaml-agent-index.md](../../docs/tied-yaml-agent-index.md). For **creating, updating, or deleting** project-owned YAML under the TIED base path (indexes, `requirements/` / `architecture-decisions/` / `implementation-decisions/` details, `semantic-tokens.yaml`, `feedback.yaml`, etc.), invoke tools only through `.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/scripts/tied-cli.sh <tool_name> '<args_json>'` (full catalog in [.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/reference.md](.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/reference.md)). Set **`TIED_BASE_PATH`** and the built server path exactly as the skill **Environment overrides** section describes so Node can run `dist/index.js`. `copy_files.sh` copies the skill into `.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/` (from the TIED repo’s `.cursor/skills/tied-yaml` if present, else from `tools/bundled-tied-yaml-skill/` in the TIED source tree). If `SKILL.md` is still missing, re-run `copy_files.sh` from a full TIED checkout, or `cp -R <TIED_repo>/tools/bundled-tied-yaml-skill .cursor/skills/tied-yaml`. Note: **`TIED_MCP_BIN` is only the server binary; it does not replace the `tied-cli.sh` wrapper and Node**—see SKILL.md. Do not use `apply_patch` or `Write` on those paths when a `tied-cli.sh` tool covers the operation (document a one-line exception only when no tool covers the operation), and do not use **`TIED_YAML_BYPASS`** for routine project TIED work when the supported path is to fix the missing skill bundle.
7. **Mandatory global sequence** (before any RED test or production code): token-commented IMPL `essence_pseudocode` → `gate-pseudocode-validation` → `persist-implementation-records` when authoring new IMPL — then RED tests → GREEN code.
8. **Within TDD** after pseudo-code is authoritative: failing test before production code. When weighing non-implementation trade-offs: Tests > Basic Functions > Developer Experience > Infrastructure > Security — never start RED or production code before IMPL pseudo-code is complete per the mandatory sequence above.
9. **Implementation freeze** until `gate-pseudocode-validation` and `persist-implementation-records` are satisfied for this REQ/changed IMPL set: do not add or modify production implementation files (application source, deliverable scripts, etc.) or automated test files. Exception only for TIED YAML and docs required by completed checklist steps (TIED paths routed per [.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/SKILL.md](.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/SKILL.md)).

**Outcomes**: Agent has read all governing documents. Session context is established.

**Reference**: `AGENTS.md` § 1-2; `ai-principles.md` § Mandatory Acknowledgment, § Checklist for AI Agents.

## translate-sponsor-intent (translate-sponsor-intent): Map sponsor wording to checklist phases (planning only)

**Goals**: Interpret driver-supplied placeholders (`{{CHANGE_TITLE}}`, `{{FEATURE_GOAL}}`, `{{FEATURE_BEHAVIOR_SUMMARY}}` when expanded by agentstream) as *sponsor context*, not as permission to skip checklist phases or implement code or tests immediately. Produce a concise written mapping from that intent onto the checklist’s ordered phases.

**Tasks**:
1. List the sponsor lines from the rendered checklist step (expanded from checklist vars when the driver passes `--checklist-var`). Treat them as informal intent, not executable orders.
2. Restate that sponsor text does not authorize writing production code, deliverable scripts, automated tests, or TIED YAML except what later steps assign.
3. Produce a numbered plan mapping sponsor intent onto checklist phases through `traceable-commit` (adjusting for branches in this workspace), including where pseudo-code gates and RED precede GREEN.
4. Do not create or modify implementation artifacts in this step—output is the translation/plan only. The next step (`change-definition`) refines this into the formal change definition.

**Outcomes**: Sponsor wording translated into an explicit checklist-phase plan; agent primed to follow slug order rather than imperative goal phrasing alone.

**Reference**: Entry points and flow in this document; `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-AGENT_REQ_CHECKLIST]`.

---

## change-definition (change-definition): Bound problem, non-goals, and measurable success

**Goals**: Articulate what is changing or being added, why, what stays the same, and measurable success criteria.

**Tasks**:
1. State **current behavior** (or "none" for a new requirement).
2. State **desired behavior**.
3. State **unchanged behavior** (explicit boundaries of what is not affected).
4. State **non-goals** (what this work intentionally does not address).
5. State **success criteria** (measurable outcomes that determine when the work is done).
6. Deliverable production code and automated tests are **out of scope** for this step; output is the written change definition (current, desired, unchanged, non-goals, success criteria) only.

**Outcomes**: A clear change definition exists. For CITDP records, this populates the `change_definition` section.

**Branch**: IF this is a bug fix AND no REQ exists for the expected behavior THEN create the missing REQ at author-requirement first, then return here to define the fix.

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-CITDP]` step 1; `ai-principles.md` § Bugs vs requirements.

---

## impact-discovery (impact-discovery): Blast radius, tied_context, IMPL inventory (Phase A)

**Goals**: Identify all affected modules, tokens, code, and tests; build an IMPL inventory table that serves as the working context for the rest of the checklist.

**Tasks**:
1. Identify affected modules and functions with their tied tokens.
2. Identify module boundaries the change touches or crosses.
3. Build `tied_context`:
   - `tied_tokens_affected` — existing REQ/ARCH/IMPL tokens touched by the change.
   - `tied_tokens_new` — tokens to be created.
4. **IMPL Discovery** (`[PROC-IMPL_CODE_TEST_SYNC]` Phase A):
   - **A1.** Load each affected IMPL detail file. Record `cross_references`, `related_decisions` (`depends_on`, `composed_with`, `see_also`), and `traceability` fields.
   - **A2.** Discover related IMPLs via four paths:
     - (a) Follow `composed_with` and `depends_on` links in `related_decisions`.
     - (b) Query shared REQ/ARCH tokens (`.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/scripts/tied-cli.sh get_decisions_for_requirement '<json>'` or index grep).
     - (c) Compare `code_locations` across IMPLs for file/function overlaps.
     - (d) Search managed source and tests for `[IMPL-*]` token references.
   - **A3.** Build an **IMPL inventory table**:

     | IMPL token | Pseudo-code loaded | Code files | Test files | Testability |
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     | *(populated per IMPL)* | | | | |

     Code files and Test files list **existing** artifacts for discovery only — not permission to create new files. Do not add or modify production source or automated tests in this step; new or changed implementation artifacts begin at `unit-test-red` (tests) and `unit-test-green` (production code) after pseudo-code is validated and persisted.

5. **Stop expanding** when no new IMPLs share code paths, REQ/ARCH tokens, or `composed_with` links with the current set.

**Outcomes**: Complete impact map; IMPL inventory table ready; all affected and related tokens identified.

**Branch**: IF the IMPL set is large (signal of high coupling) THEN consider whether IMPLs need decomposition before proceeding.

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-CITDP]` step 2; `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-IMPL_CODE_TEST_SYNC]` Phase A (A1-A3); `tied/docs/impl-code-test-linkage.md` § Phase A — Discovery.

---

## author-requirement (author-requirement): REQ index/detail and token registration

**Goals**: Create or update the requirement record so the change has a formal `[REQ-*]` token with full traceability fields.

**Tasks**:
1. Create or update the entry in `requirements.yaml` with all required fields: `name`, `category`, `priority`, `status`, `rationale` (`why`, `problems_solved`, `benefits`), `satisfaction_criteria`, `validation_criteria`, `traceability` (`architecture`, `implementation`, `tests`, `code_annotations`), `related_requirements`, `detail_file`, `metadata`.
2. Create or update the REQ detail file in `requirements/REQ-{TOKEN}.yaml` per `tied/detail-files-schema.md` § REQ.
3. Register the REQ token in `semantic-tokens.yaml`.
4. **CALL sub-yaml-edit-loop** for each changed YAML file.

**Outcomes**: REQ record exists in both the index and the detail file; token is registered in `semantic-tokens.yaml`; all YAML validated.

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-YAML_DB_OPERATIONS]` § Appending a New Record; `tied/detail-files-schema.md` § 1; `tied/semantic-tokens.md` § Token Creation Requirements.

---

## author-architecture (author-architecture): ARCH decisions linked to REQ

**Goals**: Create or update architecture decision(s) that fulfill the REQ, with cross-references.

**Tasks**:
1. Identify architectural decisions needed (or update existing ones).
2. Create or update the entry in `architecture-decisions.yaml` with `cross_references` to the REQ token(s), `decision`, `rationale`, `alternatives_considered`, `traceability`, `related_decisions`, `metadata`.
3. Create or update the ARCH detail file in `architecture-decisions/ARCH-{TOKEN}.yaml` per `tied/detail-files-schema.md` § ARCH.
4. Register each new ARCH token in `semantic-tokens.yaml`.
5. **CALL sub-yaml-edit-loop** for each changed YAML file.
6. **Agent preload (ARCH-locked)**: When ARCH and REQ have bounded the system in a material way, create or update **workspace-root** `agent-preload-contract.yaml` (see the executable checklist YAML for full conditions). Use the template at [`../../docs/agent-preload-contract-template.yaml`](../../docs/agent-preload-contract-template.yaml) in the TIED source tree, or the tied-repo layout file [`../../docs/agent-preload-contract-tied-repo.yaml`](../../docs/agent-preload-contract-tied-repo.yaml) if YAML indexes are at the repo root (no `tied/` subtree). Fill `session_bootstrap_docs` paths, `tied_paths.TIED_BASE_PATH`, and `implementation_contract` fields the ARCH decision fixes. If the pass only nicked cross-references, record that the preload was not refreshed.

**Outcomes**: ARCH records exist with REQ cross-references; tokens registered; YAML validated; `agent-preload-contract.yaml` at the workspace root created or updated when meaningful ARCH constants were introduced (or the step output records an explicit skip).

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-YAML_DB_OPERATIONS]`; `tied/detail-files-schema.md` § 2; `ai-principles.md` § Phase 1; `docs/agent-preload-contract-template.yaml` (TIED source); `docs/agent-preload-contract-tied-repo.yaml` (TIED source).

## S06: Author/Update IMPL with Pseudo-Code (catalog-pseudocode-contracts–persist-implementation-records)

**Goals**: Create or update IMPL decisions with complete `essence_pseudocode` and block-level token comments. Resolve all logical and flow issues in pseudo-code before any tests or code. Pseudo-code is the **source of consistent logic**.

**Tasks**:

### catalog-pseudocode-contracts (catalog-pseudocode-contracts): Read essence_pseudocode; extract contracts (Phase B)

1. Read each IMPL's `essence_pseudocode` sequentially. For each, note:
   - INPUT/OUTPUT/DATA declarations (and CONTROL when present).
   - Procedure names (UPPER_SNAKE or camelCase).
   - Key branches (IF/ELSE), loops (FOR ... IN), error paths (ON error, RETURN error).
   - Async boundaries (AWAIT, Promise).

### flag-insufficient-specs (flag-insufficient-specs): Blockers before tests or code

2. Flag any of the following as incomplete (resolution required before tests or code):
   - Missing INPUT or OUTPUT declarations.
   - Procedures referenced but not defined (called by name but body absent).
   - Branches without error handling on a fallible path.
   - Stub or template pseudo-code on an IMPL with `status: Active`.
   - Blocks with no token comment (violates `[PROC-IMPL_PSEUDOCODE_TOKENS]`).

### flag-contradictory-specs (flag-contradictory-specs): Cross-IMPL conflicts

3. Compare across IMPLs in the inventory table:
   - **Shared DATA conflict** — two IMPLs read/write the same DATA key with different assumptions.
   - **Ordering conflict** — IMPL-A expects to run before IMPL-B, but IMPL-B has no ordering constraint or assumes the reverse.
   - **Incompatible OUTPUT types** — IMPL-A produces `{ result }` but IMPL-B expects `{ result, metadata }` from the same procedure.
   - **Duplicate logic** — the same step appears in two IMPLs with different parameters or behavior.

**Branch**: IF two IMPLs have irreconcilable assumptions THEN refactor (split or restructure) one IMPL before proceeding. Do not paper over contradictions.

### resolve-pseudocode (resolve-pseudocode): Fix contracts; revisit REQ/ARCH if scope shifts

4. For each issue found in flag-insufficient-specs-flag-contradictory-specs:
   - Update the affected IMPL's `essence_pseudocode` so contracts are compatible, ordering is explicit, and every block is complete.
   - IF resolution changes the scope of an ARCH THEN **GOTO author-architecture** to update ARCH, then return here.
   - IF resolution changes the scope of a REQ THEN **GOTO author-requirement** to update REQ, then return here.

### apply-token-comments (apply-token-comments): Block-level IMPL/ARCH/REQ comments (Phase C)

5. Apply `[PROC-IMPL_PSEUDOCODE_TOKENS]` to every IMPL in the set:
   - **Top-level comment**: `# [IMPL-X] [ARCH-Y] [REQ-Z]` followed by a one-line summary.
   - **Sub-blocks (same token set)**: comment only the *how* (no token list repetition).
   - **Sub-blocks (different token set)**: open with `# [IMPL-...] [ARCH-...] [REQ-...]` naming that set and stating how the sub-block implements them.
6. **Cross-IMPL dependency comments**: when a procedure in IMPL-A calls or depends on IMPL-B, the calling block in IMPL-A names IMPL-B (and its ARCH/REQ) so the dependency is visible.
7. **Collision and composition notes**: for each `composed_with` pair or code-path overlap, document:
   - **Ordering**: which IMPL's procedure runs first and why.
   - **Shared data**: which DATA keys are read/written by both; expected state at each boundary.
   - **Pre/post conditions**: what each IMPL expects before it runs and guarantees after.

### gate-pseudocode-validation (gate-pseudocode-validation): sub-pseudocode-validation-pass and gating before persist

**CALL sub-pseudocode-validation-pass.** Run pseudo-code validation per `[PROC-PSEUDOCODE_VALIDATION]` using `tied/docs/pseudocode-validation-checklist.yaml` (or `docs/pseudocode-validation-checklist.yaml` at repo root). Run validation passes in the recommended order; record findings with severity and source location. Treat required checks as gating: do not proceed to persist-implementation-records until minimum gating rules are satisfied (or explicitly waived and documented). If the project has no parser or tool yet, perform a **manual pass** over the checklist categories (parsing → schema → symbol resolution → contract → dependency graph → coverage → traceability → reporting) and document results.

### persist-implementation-records (persist-implementation-records): IMPL index/detail via tied-cli.sh; sub-yaml-edit-loop

8. Create or update `implementation-decisions.yaml` index entries with all required fields.
9. Create or update IMPL detail files in `implementation-decisions/IMPL-{TOKEN}.yaml` per `tied/detail-files-schema.md` § IMPL. Include complete `essence_pseudocode`.
10. Register each new IMPL token in `semantic-tokens.yaml`.
11. **CALL sub-yaml-edit-loop** for each changed YAML file.
12. **Agent preload (IMPL-locked)**: Refresh **workspace-root** `agent-preload-contract.yaml` using IMPL-anchored data: e.g. `code_locations` → `implementation_contract.target_source_paths`, test or harness paths from IMPL detail, `citdp_artifact_paths` per CITDP policy, language/test stack when known. Reconcile when this step is verify-only for IMPL if path lists may be stale. Keep the preload narrow (see template comments); avoid whole-repo rediscovery.

**Outcomes**: All IMPL pseudo-code is complete, authoritative, and token-commented. No contradictions or gaps remain. All YAML validated. `agent-preload-contract.yaml` matches IMPL-locked paths and constants (or is explicitly left unchanged with reason).

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-IMPL_CODE_TEST_SYNC]` Phases B-C; `tied/implementation-decisions.md` § Mandatory essence_pseudocode, § Preferred vocabulary, § Expressing sequence and structure; `tied/docs/impl-code-test-linkage.md` §§ 2-3; `tied/docs/pseudocode-writing-and-validation.md` and `tied/docs/pseudocode-validation-checklist.yaml` for pseudo-code validation; `docs/agent-preload-contract-template.yaml`; `docs/agent-preload-contract-tied-repo.yaml` (paths relative to repo root in TIED source).

## risk-assessment (risk-assessment): Risks, mitigations, token references

**Goals**: Identify and document risks associated with the change.

**Tasks**:
1. List risks with severity and likelihood.
2. Where applicable, attach `tied_token_references` to each risk (which REQ/ARCH/IMPL the risk affects).
3. Document mitigation strategies.

**Outcomes**: Risks documented with token references. Mitigations identified.

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-CITDP]` step 4.

## test-strategy (test-strategy): Test matrix, classification, mandatory order

**Goals**: Classify testability for each IMPL block; produce a test matrix; plan the TDD sequence.

**Tasks**:
1. For each IMPL block/procedure, classify as: `unit`, `integration`, or `e2e_only`.
2. IF `e2e_only` THEN document `e2e_only_reason` naming the specific platform constraint in the IMPL detail. "Complex UI flow" is not a sufficient reason; a named platform constraint is required (e.g., "native OS file dialog cannot be triggered programmatically in the test environment").
3. Build a **test matrix**:

   | Test name | IMPL block ref | REQ token | Token comments | Testability |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | *(populated per test)* | | | | |

4. Plan the TDD sequence per mandatory implementation order:
   - (1) Unit tests first (conform to IMPL pseudo-code, before production code).
   - (2) Unit code via TDD (code satisfies tests; entire IMPL via TDD).
   - (3) Composition tests first (for every binding between units).
   - (4) Composition code via TDD (binding code satisfies composition tests).
   - (5) E2E (only for behavior requiring UI invocation).
   - (6) Validate and sync.
5. Identify module boundaries and validation criteria per `[REQ-MODULE_VALIDATION]`.

**Outcomes**: Test matrix complete; every IMPL block has a testability classification; TDD sequence planned; module boundaries documented.

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-TEST_STRATEGY]`; `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-CITDP]` step 5; `ai-principles.md` § Thin Entry Points and Testability Classification; `tied/docs/implementation-order.md`.

## S09 (unit-tdd): Unit TDD (Phases D–E–F)

**Goals**: Implement all unit-testable IMPL blocks via strict TDD while maintaining three-way alignment (pseudo-code / tests / code).

```
LOOP FOR each IMPL block classified as unit or integration in test-strategy:
```

### unit-test-red (unit-test-red): One failing test per pseudo-code block (Phase D)

**Goals**: Map pseudo-code to a failing test.

**Tasks**:
1. Map the pseudo-code block/procedure to one test group (`describe`/`it` or test function). One block maps to approximately one test group.
2. Name the test group after the procedure and include the REQ token (e.g., `describe("SAVE_WORKFLOW REQ_DATA_SAVE", ...)`).
3. Carry the **same** REQ/ARCH/IMPL token comment as the pseudo-code block, stating *what the test validates*:
   ```
   // [IMPL-X] [ARCH-Y] [REQ-Z] — validates that PROCEDURE returns { ok }
   //   when input is valid and DEPENDENCY succeeds.
   ```
4. Write the failing test. Run the test suite. Confirm the test fails for the expected reason. No production code is written in this step.
5. Verify the assertion corresponds to the OUTPUT or effect described in the pseudo-code block.
6. IF no programmatic assertion can be written for the block THEN mark it `testability: e2e_only` in the IMPL detail with `e2e_only_reason`; skip to the next block.

**Outcomes**: Failing test exists that matches pseudo-code; no production code written.

### unit-test-green (unit-test-green): Minimal code to pass (Phase E)

**Goals**: Write the minimum code to pass the failing test.

**Tasks**:
1. Write only enough production code to make the failing test pass.
2. Carry the **same** REQ/ARCH/IMPL token comment as the pseudo-code block, stating *how the code implements*:
   ```
   // [IMPL-X] [ARCH-Y] [REQ-Z] — PROCEDURE: validates input, delegates
   //   to DEPENDENCY, returns { ok }.
   ```
   Nested blocks follow the same rules: same token set comments only *how*; different token set names that set.
3. Run tests. IF tests fail THEN iterate on production code only (do not add new tests in GREEN).
4. Run language-specific lint: Rust → `bun run lint:rust`; TypeScript → `bunx tsc -b` or `bun run lint:ts`; Swift → `swift build && swift test`; YAML → run `lint_yaml` on changed files per [PROC-YAML_EDIT_LOOP] (`processes.md`). IF lint fails THEN fix before proceeding.

**Branch**: IF GREEN reveals the pseudo-code is incomplete, wrong, or requires a new dependency THEN **CALL sub-leap-micro-cycle**. Do not silently diverge.

**Outcomes**: Test passes; lint clean; code carries correct token comments.

### unit-refactor (unit-refactor): Optional behavior-preserving cleanup

**Goals**: Improve code quality without changing behavior.

**Tasks**:
1. Clean up test or production code (extract functions, rename, simplify).
2. Re-run tests + lint. Confirm no regressions.

**Outcomes**: Code is cleaner; all tests still pass; lint still clean.

### three-way-alignment-unit (three-way-alignment-unit): Align pseudo-code, tests, code; token audit (Phase F)

**Goals**: Verify that pseudo-code, tests, and code carry identical token sets with corresponding descriptions.

**Tasks**:
1. For every block in this iteration, verify the three artifacts carry the **same** token set:

   | Artifact | Comment content |
   |---|---|
   | **Pseudo-code block** | `# [IMPL-X] [ARCH-Y] [REQ-Z] — how this block implements ...` |
   | **Test block** | `// [IMPL-X] [ARCH-Y] [REQ-Z] — validates that ...` |
   | **Code block** | `// [IMPL-X] [ARCH-Y] [REQ-Z] — how this code implements ...` |

   IF any artifact names a token not present in the other two, or omits a token that the others carry, alignment is broken.

2. IF any diverge THEN update pseudo-code first, then test, then code (LEAP order: IMPL → test → code).
3. Run `[PROC-TOKEN_AUDIT]`: every token named in any of the three must exist in `semantic-tokens.yaml`. IF missing tokens THEN register them and **CALL sub-yaml-edit-loop**.

**Outcomes**: Three-way alignment verified for the iteration. All tokens registered.

```
END LOOP (repeat unit-test-red → unit-test-green → unit-refactor → three-way-alignment-unit
          UNTIL all unit/integration IMPL blocks are covered and all tests pass)
```

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-IMPL_CODE_TEST_SYNC]` Phases D-F (steps 11-20); `tied/docs/impl-code-test-linkage.md` § Stage 2 — Unit TDD; `tied/docs/implementation-order.md` steps 1-2.

---

## composition-integration (composition-integration): Bindings without UI; test-first wiring (Phase G)

**Goals**: Test bindings between validated modules without invoking the UI. Every binding between units must have IMPL coverage and a composition test.

**Tasks**:
1. **Identify bindings**: event listeners, IPC channels, entry-point delegation, function wiring, platform hooks. Each binding connects two or more units validated independently in S09.
2. **For each binding**, locate the IMPL whose `essence_pseudocode` describes the composition (often in ON/WHEN event handlers or wiring procedures):
   - IF an IMPL block describes the binding THEN proceed to step 3.
   - IF no IMPL covers the binding AND the binding belongs to an existing IMPL THEN extend that IMPL's pseudo-code to add a composition block. **GOTO apply-token-comments** (apply token comments to the new block), **CALL sub-yaml-edit-loop**, then return here.
   - IF no IMPL covers the binding AND the binding is a distinct design decision THEN create a new IMPL. **GOTO S06** (full IMPL authoring from catalog-pseudocode-contracts), then return here.
3. Write a **failing composition test** for each binding (before composition code):
   - Carries the IMPL block's token comments.
   - Verifies: trigger fires → correct unit called → correct arguments → correct effect.
   - Does **not** invoke the UI. IF it would require UI invocation THEN it belongs in end-to-end-ui (E2E), not here.
4. Write **composition code** to pass the test. No composition code without a preceding failing test.
5. Apply three-way alignment (same rules as three-way-alignment-unit).
6. Run tests + lint. Fix any failures.

**Outcomes**: All bindings have composition tests; composition code passes; three-way alignment holds.

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-IMPL_CODE_TEST_SYNC]` Phase G (steps 21-24); `tied/docs/impl-code-test-linkage.md` § 4 — From unit modules to composition; `tied/docs/implementation-order.md` steps 3-4. For this project’s binding inventory and coverage, see `tied/docs/composition-coverage.md`.

---

## end-to-end-ui (end-to-end-ui): UI-only behavior with platform justification (Phase H)

**Goals**: Cover behavior that genuinely requires UI invocation. E2E does not substitute for composition tests.

**Tasks**:
1. Identify E2E-only behavior: native OS menus, visual rendering, platform behavior that cannot be simulated below E2E. Everything else should already be covered by unit or composition tests from S09-composition-integration.
2. Confirm the IMPL detail file has:
   - `testability: e2e_only`.
   - `e2e_only_reason` naming the specific platform constraint (e.g., "native OS file dialog cannot be triggered programmatically in JSDOM or Playwright").
   - A block in `essence_pseudocode` that documents the E2E-only boundary with a comment (e.g., `# E2E-only: platform onMessage binding`).
3. Write E2E test referencing REQ and IMPL tokens. A comment in the test justifies why composition-level testing is insufficient (repeating or referencing `e2e_only_reason`).
4. E2E does **not** substitute for composition tests. IF a binding is testable below E2E THEN it must have a composition test even if E2E also covers it.

**Decision gate**: "Can I fire this trigger programmatically (via a function call, message, or event) and observe the effect without a browser/UI?" IF yes THEN it is a composition test (composition-integration), not E2E.

**Branch**: IF E2E reveals a missing IMPL block THEN **GOTO S06** to create or extend the IMPL pseudo-code, then return here.

**Outcomes**: E2E tests exist for all UI-only behavior; each is justified with a named platform constraint.

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-IMPL_CODE_TEST_SYNC]` Phase H (steps 25-28); `tied/docs/impl-code-test-linkage.md` § 4 — The E2E decision; `tied/docs/implementation-order.md` step 4.

---

## verification-gate (verification-gate): Full suite, lint, token validation, audit, metadata (Phase I)

**Goals**: Confirm everything is aligned, passing, and consistent. This is the compound gate that must pass before work is considered complete.

**Tasks**:
1. Run the **full test suite** (unit, composition, E2E). All must pass.
2. Run **lint** for each language in scope: Rust → `bun run lint:rust`; TypeScript → `bunx tsc -b`; Swift → `swift build && swift test`; YAML → run `lint_yaml` on changed files per [PROC-YAML_EDIT_LOOP] (`processes.md`).
3. Run **`[PROC-TOKEN_VALIDATION]`**: `./scripts/validate_tokens.sh` when the project provides it (see `tied/docs/token-validation.md`), and always run **`.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/scripts/tied-cli.sh tied_validate_consistency '{}'`**; fix any issues before proceeding.
4. **Final three-way alignment audit**: for every IMPL touched, verify pseudo-code / test / code carry the same token set with logically corresponding descriptions. Document remaining `e2e_only` blocks and confirm each has `e2e_only_reason`.
5. **Update IMPL detail metadata** for each changed IMPL detail file:
   - `traceability.tests` — list all tests that validate this IMPL.
   - `code_locations` — update files and functions to reflect the current code.
   - `metadata.last_updated` — date, author, reason.
   - **CALL sub-yaml-edit-loop** on each changed detail file.
6. **Module validation** per `[REQ-MODULE_VALIDATION]`: confirm each module was validated independently before integration. Document validation results.

**Outcomes**: All tests pass; lint clean; token validation passes; three-way alignment verified; IMPL metadata current; module validation documented.

**Branch**: IF any validation fails THEN fix the issue and re-run from the appropriate earlier step:
- Test failure → return to S09 (unit) or composition-integration (composition) or end-to-end-ui (E2E).
- Lint failure → fix code, re-run lint.
- Token validation failure → register missing tokens, fix traceability gaps.
- Three-way alignment failure → apply LEAP order (pseudo-code first, then test, then code).

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-IMPL_CODE_TEST_SYNC]` Phase I (steps 29-33); `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-CITDP]` step 7.

---

## sync-tied-stack (sync-tied-stack): TIED docs match implementation; consistency via tied-cli.sh

**Goals**: Ensure TIED documentation matches the final implementation. TIED docs remain the single source of truth for intent.

**Tasks**:
1. Update REQ/ARCH/IMPL index entries and detail files so they match the final code and tests. Ensure IMPLs modified this session reflect the implemented code, including block-level comments with semantic tokens.
2. Sync `semantic-tokens.yaml`, `requirements.yaml`, `architecture-decisions.yaml`, and `implementation-decisions.yaml` (and detail files) so no documentation drift exists.
3. **CALL sub-yaml-edit-loop** on every changed file.
4. Run `.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/scripts/tied-cli.sh tied_validate_consistency '{}'` — must report `"ok": true`.
5. If REQ/ARCH/IMPL `status`, `traceability.tests`, or similar fields changed such that a session `agent_preload` would be stale, re-check **workspace-root** `agent-preload-contract.yaml` and patch only as needed; do not redo the full ARCH/IMPL preload passes unless something material changed.

**Branch**: IF divergence between TIED docs and code/tests is detected THEN apply LEAP:
- Update IMPL first (GOTO resolve-pseudocode scope).
- IF scope changed, update ARCH (GOTO author-architecture scope).
- IF scope changed, update REQ (GOTO author-requirement scope).
- Then return here and re-run consistency validation.

**Outcomes**: TIED docs are consistent with implementation; `tied_validate_consistency` passes; `agent-preload-contract.yaml` re-checked or left unchanged with reason when sync did not affect preload-relevant TIED fields.

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-TIED_DEV_CYCLE]` steps 8-9; `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-LEAP]`; `docs/agent-preload-contract-template.yaml` (repo root).

---

## user-facing-release-notes (user-facing-release-notes): README and CHANGELOG

**Goals**: Record user-facing and release-facing changes made in this session.

**Tasks**:
1. Update `README.md` for any user-facing changes (new features, changed behavior, setup instructions).
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` for release-facing changes (features, fixes, breaking changes).

**Outcomes**: External documentation reflects the session's changes.

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-TIED_DEV_CYCLE]` step 9.

---

## persist-citdp-record (persist-citdp-record): CITDP YAML under client docs/citdp

**Goals**: Store the change-analysis record so the analysis, decisions, and outcomes are available for future reference.

**Tasks**:
1. Populate the CITDP YAML record with:
   - **Record identity**: change request ID, date, author.
   - **Change definition** (from change-definition): current behavior, desired behavior, unchanged behavior, non-goals, success criteria.
   - **Impact analysis** (from impact-discovery): affected modules, tied_context, IMPL inventory.
   - **Risk analysis** (from risk-assessment): risks with token references.
   - **Test strategy** (from test-strategy): test matrix, testability classifications.
   - **TDD sequence** (from S09-end-to-end-ui): what was implemented and in what order.
   - **Completion criteria**: validation results from verification-gate.
   - **LEAP feedback**: `divergences_from_analysis` (any places where implementation differed from the original analysis), `tied_stack_updates_required` (LEAP propagations triggered), `record_status`.
2. Store as `tied/citdp/CITDP-{change_request_id}.yaml` relative to the **client project workspace root**—the repository where the implementation and **project** `tied/` tree live (the same repo you commit for this work). Do **not** persist CITDP only under a separate checkout of the TIED methodology repository when the client is another project; optional mirrors or alternate paths are policy-specific and do not replace the canonical client path.
3. **CALL sub-yaml-edit-loop** on the record file.

**Outcomes**: CITDP record stored and validated; analysis available for future reference.

**Branch**: IF YAML validation fails THEN fix and repeat step 3. When to create vs skip a CITDP record: see `tied/docs/citdp-policy.md`.

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-CITDP]` step 8; `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-YAML_DB_OPERATIONS]`; `tied/docs/citdp-policy.md` (project policy).

---

## traceable-commit (traceable-commit): Commit per PROC-COMMIT_MESSAGES; no push unless asked

**Goals**: Create a traceable commit with proper format and token references.

**Tasks**:
1. Write the commit message per `[PROC-COMMIT_MESSAGES]`:
   - **Header**: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` (keep the full header line to 50 characters or fewer).
   - **Type**: One of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`.
   - **Scope**: Area affected (e.g., `core`, `ui`, `tied`, `tests`). See `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-COMMIT_MESSAGES]` for the full scope list.
   - **Subject**: Imperative, present tense; no capitalization; no period.
   - **Body**: Motivation and behavior change (imperative tense). Keep lines to 100 characters.
   - **Footer**: `Closes #issue` or `Fixes #issue` if applicable. Reference main REQ/ARCH/IMPL tokens touched.
2. Stage relevant files. Commit.
3. Do NOT push unless explicitly asked.

**Outcomes**: Commit exists with proper format; TIED tokens referenced in body or footer.

**EXIT**: Checklist complete. Do not create a stand-alone summary document.

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-COMMIT_MESSAGES]`.

## Sub-Procedures

### sub-yaml-edit-loop (sub-yaml-edit-loop): tied-cli.sh mutations, lint_yaml, tied_validate_consistency

**Invoked by**: Any step that creates or modifies TIED YAML (author-requirement, author-architecture, S06, three-way-alignment-unit, composition-integration, verification-gate, sync-tied-stack, persist-citdp-record).

**Goals**: Ensure every TIED YAML file is syntactically valid and canonically formatted before use. **Mutations** to project-owned TIED YAML go through `.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/scripts/tied-cli.sh` per [.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/SKILL.md](.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/SKILL.md) (tool names and JSON args in [.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/reference.md](.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/reference.md)). Agents use **`lint_yaml`** per [PROC-YAML_EDIT_LOOP] (`processes.md`); it may accept multiple paths but must process each file independently—never raw multi-argument `yq` pretty-print, which merges documents and corrupts files.

**Tasks**:
1. **Mutation path**: IF you are creating, updating, or deleting project-owned files under the TIED base path, use the appropriate `tied-cli.sh` tool from the skill. Do not bypass with `apply_patch`/`Write` when the same operation is supported by `tied-cli.sh`.
2. Run `lint_yaml` on each changed file, or one `lint_yaml` invocation with multiple paths if your wrapper implements per-file safe passes (required for any **direct-edited** exception file; files written via `tied-cli.sh` may still be normalized this way if your workflow runs it on all touched paths). This validates syntax and canonicalizes formatting in place.
3. IF validation fails THEN fix the YAML error and repeat step 2. The file is not valid for use until this passes.
4. Run `.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/scripts/tied-cli.sh tied_validate_consistency '{}'` for cross-file traceability before marking TIED work complete (and when the calling step requires it).
5. IF consistency check fails THEN fix the issue in the TIED stack (prefer `yaml_detail_update` / `yaml_index_update` via `tied-cli.sh`) and **RETURN** to the calling step to re-validate.

**Outcomes**: YAML file is syntactically valid, canonically formatted, consistent with the TIED graph where validated, and ready for use by `tied-cli.sh`, scripts, and downstream steps.

**RETURN** to calling step.

**Reference**: `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-YAML_EDIT_LOOP]`; [.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/SKILL.md](.cursor/skills/tied-yaml/SKILL.md); `tied/docs/methodology-diagrams.md` Diagram 6.

---

### sub-pseudocode-validation-pass (sub-pseudocode-validation-pass): Checklist-ordered passes until gating satisfied

**Invoked by**: gate-pseudocode-validation (Run Pseudo-Code Validation).

**Goals**: Ensure IMPL pseudo-code satisfies the application pseudo-code validation checklist before persisting or writing tests/code. Required checks are gating unless waived and documented.

**Tasks**:
1. Load the checklist from `tied/docs/pseudocode-validation-checklist.yaml` (or `docs/pseudocode-validation-checklist.yaml` at repo root).
2. For each pseudo-code block in the IMPL set (from S06), run each validation category in the checklist's **recommended_validation_order**; collect findings with severity and block/location.
3. IF any required check fails OR minimum gating rules are not met THEN fix pseudo-code (or ARCH/REQ if scope changed), then repeat from step 2. **RETURN** only when gating rules pass or a waiver is documented.
4. **RETURN** to caller (gate-pseudocode-validation continues to persist-implementation-records).

**Outcomes**: Pseudo-code validation report (findings by category, severity, location); all required checks pass or are waived; minimum gating rules satisfied.

**Reference**: `tied/docs/pseudocode-writing-and-validation.md`; `tied/docs/pseudocode-validation-checklist.yaml`; `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-PSEUDOCODE_VALIDATION]`.

---

### sub-leap-micro-cycle (leap-micro-cycle): Fix IMPL first during GREEN; revisit REQ/ARCH if scope shifts

**Invoked by**: unit-test-green when production code reveals the pseudo-code is incomplete, wrong, or missing a dependency.

**Goals**: Keep pseudo-code authoritative at every point during TDD. Prevent silent divergence, which is the primary way traceability breaks.

**Tasks**:
1. **STOP** writing production code immediately.
2. **Update IMPL** `essence_pseudocode`: add the missing block, fix the contract, or add the new dependency comment. **CALL sub-yaml-edit-loop** on the detail file.
3. **Update or add the test** to match the corrected pseudo-code. Carry the same token comments.
4. **Update the production code** to pass the corrected test. Carry the same token comments.
5. **Verify three-way alignment** for the affected block (per three-way-alignment-unit rules).
6. IF the change affects ARCH scope THEN update ARCH: **GOTO author-architecture** (scoped to the affected ARCH), **CALL sub-yaml-edit-loop**, then return here.
7. IF the change affects REQ scope THEN update REQ: **GOTO author-requirement** (scoped to the affected REQ), **CALL sub-yaml-edit-loop**, then return here.

**Outcomes**: Pseudo-code remained authoritative at every point. No silent divergence occurred. Three-way alignment holds for the affected block.

**RETURN** to the calling TDD iteration (unit-test-green continues with the next assertion or block).

**Reference**: `tied/docs/impl-code-test-linkage.md` § 3 — LEAP Micro-Cycle During TDD; `tied/processes.md` § `[PROC-LEAP]` rule 1.
